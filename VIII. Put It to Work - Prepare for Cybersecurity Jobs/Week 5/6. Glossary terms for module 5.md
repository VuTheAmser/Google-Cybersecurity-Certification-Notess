Terms and definitions from Course 8, Module 5
AI bias: Risks involved when bias is present in artificial intelligence (AI) data, potentially leading to inaccurate, unfair, or unreliable outputs

Artificial intelligence (AI): Computer programs designed to perform cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and understanding language

Context (in prompting): The necessary details provided to an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to help it understand what you need from it

Evaluate (in prompting): The step in the TCREI framework where you review the output from an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to determine if it meets your needs and expectations

Generative AI (Gen AI): A type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of creating new content, such as text, images, code, or other media, in response to prompts

Human-in-the-loop approach: A method of using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly that combines the strengths of machine intelligence with human oversight, involvement, and validation to train, use, verify, and refine AI results

Iterate (in prompting): The process in the TCREI framework of refining and improving artificial intelligence (AI) prompts and outputs through repeated cycles of testing and adjustments to achieve desired results

Prompt: The input (which can be text, images, or other data) you provide to an artificial intelligence (AI) model to elicit a specific response or generate new content

References (in prompting): Examples or specific information provided to an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to use as a guide when creating its output

STAR method: A storytelling framework that helps you communicate your experience and skills in a clear, concise, and compelling way to help interviewer understand exactly how you successfully managed certain situation; stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result; you’ll learn more about this method in the last course of the certificate 

Task (in prompting): The specific instruction or goal you give to an artificial intelligence (AI) model, often including details about the desired persona and format for the output

TCREI framework: A practical framework for writing effective prompts for generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which stands for Task, Context, References, Evaluate, and Iterate
